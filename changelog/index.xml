Markdown format checking Deepdwn can now check your documents for formatting consistency and errors with MarkdownLint.
Deepdwn can warn you if:
Your headings end with punctuation You reversed the parentheses and brackets in your links Your numbered lists are out of order You have trailing spaces after your text And a ton of other things.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.31.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-31-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 20:40:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-31-0/</guid><description>Paste rich text to markdown When you paste HTML content into Deepdwn (copied from a webpage or online document editing tool), Deepdwn will now do its very best to convert it into markdown. This can be a huge time saver when importing formatted content and tables especially.
As a side effect, Deepdwn now supports copy/pasting spreadsheet data directly from Google Sheets, LibreOffice, and Office 365. Others may or may not work!</description></item><item><title>Version 0.30.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-30-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 12:00:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-30-0/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a handful of features, changes and bugfixes for you with 0.30!
Multiple tag selection You can now select multiple tags in the filters panel by holding control while clicking them, to further filter your files.
When multiple tags are selected, only files containing all of the selected tags will be visible in the file list.
While you can still only select one category or folder at a time (since a file can only be in a single category or folder), you can now select a category and a folder and one or more tags at the same time to locate files which match all of those criteria.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.29.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-29-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 16:54:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-29-0/</guid><description>Markdown templates Do you find yourself starting documents the same way over and over? Maybe you use the same set of categories or tags, maybe you always add the current date to your blog posts, or maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t like copying YAML every time.
Deepdwn now supports markdown templates to save you a couple of steps.
To create a new template, simply add the tag template to a document&amp;rsquo;s frontmatter, and it will appear in the New File From Template entry in the File menu, or select it from the new drop down next to the New File button in the top bar.</description></item></channel></rss>
