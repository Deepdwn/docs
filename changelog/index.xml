Local image handling Deepdwn can now display images from your local machine. Both absolute paths, and paths relative to the current document are supported. Setting an image directory via yaml frontmatter may be supported later.
For example:
![A Happy goat!](/home/myname/pictures/goat.jpg) ![A Happy goat!](../goat.jpg) ![A Happy goat!](C:\Users\MyName\Pictures\goat.jpg) Note that paths with spaces in them are not supported in markdown, so you&amp;rsquo;ll either want to replace these with URL escaped space characters %20, ex:</description></item><item><title>Version 0.19.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-19-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 00:23:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-19-0/</guid><description>List continuation When typing a list, pressing enter/return will now insert a new list item at the same indentation level. This works for check lists as well. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want that item, just press enter again.
Center and Highlight Paragraphs can now be centered with -&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;-.
Deepdwn now also supports highlighting text with ==text==.
The code for this in the editor and preview is not identical, so you may see some slight differences in behavior between the two for some edge cases.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.18.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-18-0/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 17:00:16 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-18-0/</guid><description>This update brings a number of changes to improve Deepdwn&amp;rsquo;s accessibility, particularly for keyboard-only and screen reader users.
I need to stress that I&amp;rsquo;m not an accessibility expert, and these changes represent a work in progress for accessibility in Deepdwn. If you have specific suggestions in this area, or something isn&amp;rsquo;t working for you that really ought to be, please reach out and let me know and I will try to fix it.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.17.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-17-0/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 21:42:20 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-17-0/</guid><description>The big update I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to launch this update, there&amp;rsquo;s some good stuff in here.
New name and branding First, JotDown has been renamed to Deepdwn. There are a couple of reasons for this, but mostly it should be much easier to find by name. (Project downloads may still be called JotDown.zip for a bit)
The Itch.io page has been updated with a spiffy new design to help highlight features, and the app has a new icon.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.14.2</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-14-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 17:55:02 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-14-2/</guid><description>This update brings a few features to improve usability when managing more files.
File list updates The file list now has a search field! This will search all (currently visible, subject to tag/category/folder filtering) files, based on their content or filename.
The file list now shows the currently selected folder or tag or category in the heading at the top to help make it more obvious that you&amp;rsquo;re looking at a filtered set of files.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.13.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-13-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 17:49:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-13-0/</guid><description>Ascii Tabs JotDown now supports guitar tabs in the (much more common) ascii tab format. These are properly syntax highlighted in the editor like the other musical formats. An example has been added to the Show Me an Example document.
Minor features More mellow and more attractive editor colors in dark mode. When a syntax error causes a chart or ascii tab blocks not to render, a warning icon will appear in the preview window, with more details when you hover over it.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.12.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-12-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 17:46:21 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-12-0/</guid><description>This update adds a bunch of stuff!
Find and Replace This and UI scaling are the two most important features I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to add. It (hopefully) works the way you&amp;rsquo;d expect.
UI Scaling / Font Size You can now scale all text and UI together using the View menu, or the Ctrl/Cmd + Mousewheel. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a screenshot for this but you can move your head closer and further from the screenshot above to simulate it.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.10.3</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-10-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:42:23 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-10-3/</guid><description>This updated ended up larger than expected, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited for these changes.
Music! First is a feature I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to add since starting: Rendering of sheetmusic and tabs from a (fairly) user friendly format.
Sheetmusic uses the ABC notation format, and is written inside a code block beginning with ```music or ```abc.
Guitar tabs and chords jTab, and are written in code blocks beginning with ```tab or ```guitar.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.10.2</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-10-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 17:39:46 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-10-2/</guid><description>Version 0.10.2 brings a handful of style updates:
The main UI font is slightly bolder, larger and more readable (especially the list of files) Titles in the file list are bold, and have alternating background colors, which should make them more readable with many available files File list background and hover behavior better matches the rest of the app Custom scrollbar styles (basic, but less bulky). The resizing area between UI panels is a little smaller, making it easier to manually click/drag the scrollbar when visible.</description></item><item><title>Version 0.10.0</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-10-0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 17:38:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/changelog/version-0-10-0/</guid><description>JotDown now supports spellchecking! Finally.
Right-click misspelled words to see a list of spelling suggestions, or add the word to your dictionary. To remove a word from your dictionary, select it, right-click, and choose &amp;ldquo;Remove from dictionary&amp;rdquo;.
With this last critical feature, JotDown is also moving to paid-only license. If you&amp;rsquo;ve already purchased JotDown (for any amount) you&amp;rsquo;ll retain your license and have access to this and future updates.</description></item></channel></rss>
