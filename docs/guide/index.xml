Deepdwn will read the markdown files in this folder, and all nested folders, and populate your available tags and categories, and allow you to find documents by searching.
For performance and organization, it&amp;rsquo;s best to choose a dedicated notes directory of some kind for this, rather than your entire home directory or the root of your hard drive, since Deepdwn needs to find and read all of the markdown files inside.</description></item><item><title>Shortcuts</title><link>https://support.deepdwn.com/docs/guide/shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://support.deepdwn.com/docs/guide/shortcuts/</guid><description>Application shortcuts Shortcut Description Ctrl .
