There are no plans to integrate Deepdwn with any synchronization services.
However, Deepdwn is designed to work with any services you already have set up. Just sync your notes directory like you would any other.
Will Deepdwn add a WYSIWYG mode? I&amp;rsquo;d like to have this option eventually, but it&amp;rsquo;s a huge feature and it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely to be added any time soon.
Where can I get support?</description></item></channel></rss>
