A small bugfix release for 0.40

## Bugfixes

* Fixed markdown and yaml formatting warnings failing to appear
* Fixed collapsing markdown headings not working, or not collapsing the right content in some circumstances
* Slightly improved clicking outline headers staying selected when the document scrolls to the new position. This will not be 100% correct but may be improved in the future
* Fixed brand new documents using the wrong initial formatting before navigating
