Version 0.10.2 brings a handful of style updates:

* The main UI font is slightly bolder, larger and more readable (especially the list of files)
* Titles in the file list are bold, and have alternating background colors, which should make them more readable with many available files
* File list background and hover behavior better matches the rest of the app
* Custom scrollbar styles (basic, but less bulky).
* The resizing area between UI panels is a little smaller, making it easier to manually click/drag the scrollbar when visible.
