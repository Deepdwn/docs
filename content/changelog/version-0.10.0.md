JotDown now supports spellchecking! Finally.

Right-click misspelled words to see a list of spelling suggestions, or add the word to your dictionary. To remove a word from your dictionary, select it, right-click, and choose "Remove from dictionary".

With this last critical feature, JotDown is also moving to paid-only license. If you've already purchased JotDown (for any amount) you'll retain your license and have access to this and future updates.

Ideally, I'd like to have JotDown purchases  pay for (expensive) code signing certificates, to get rid of the scary warning when launching (or having to jump through hoops just to run it), but this hasn't happened so far. Maybe some day!
