These panels can be resized by grabbing the separator between them, or collapsed and expanded by double clicking the label at the top.\nFilters panel  The first panel, Filters, shows your tags, categories and folders. You can select these to filter the file list (the next panel), and deselect them to see all files again.\nYou can also double click the section headings sections to collapse them.\nThe Drafts filter at the top is always available. Here you\u0026rsquo;ll find files which have not yet been saved for the first time.\nFiles panel  The second panel, Files, displays a list of files based on your currently selected filters, or all files if no filters have been selected.\nRight clicking these files will display additional options, allowing you to delete files, show their location in your file system, pin them to the top of the list, or duplicate them as needed.\nThe top of this panel has a search field which will further filter the displayed files as you type. Filenames, and all file content will be considered when searching.\nOutline panel  The third panel, Outline, shows all the headings in your current file. Clicking a heading will take you that section of your document.\nEditor panel  This is is the main panel in Deepdwn, where you edit your files.\nOrganizing your files You can tell Deepdwn about your files and how you organize them by editing the files themselves. Deepdwn supports a format known as YAML frontmatter, which appears at the very top of your documents, and looks like this:\n---title:My Favorite Cakescategory:Blogtags:- favorites- 🧁 baking- musingspinned:truedir:ltr---# Welcome to my cake postThis document has the title My Favorite Cakes, is in the category Blog and has three tags, favorites, 🧁 baking, and musings. You can add as few or as many tags as you\u0026rsquo;d like. The document direction is set to left-to-right, and the document is \u0026ldquo;pinned\u0026rdquo; so that it always appears at the top of the file list.\nThese fields (title, category, tags, and dir) are the only ones that Deepdwn uses currently, but you can add any other fields you need as well. Many other systems support markdown with the same frontmatter, so you can add what you need to support those systems.\nOnce a file has been saved, its category and tags will be added to the filters panel, and the title (if present) will replace the Untitled name in the file list. If no title has been added, the filename will be used instead.\nWorking with markdown  Markdown\u0026rsquo;s formatting is intended to be readable as-is without any coversion. Deepdwn enhances (but does not hide) this formatting by applying bold, italic, and a wide range of other formatting as you type.\nPress the question mark icon in the toolbar to open a reference document with all of Deepdwn\u0026rsquo;s supported markdown formatting.\nRendering your markdown To view your document without seeing markdown syntax and to render charts and music, you can press the preview button in the toolbar to open a new window with your fully rendered document.\nThe preview will be updated as you add to and edit your document, and can be exported to PDF or HTML from the save icon in the corner.\nOptions  Deepdwn supports some alternate display and behavior options. These can be changed from the preferences view, available by pressing the Preferences gear in the lower left hand corner of the application, or with the keystroke  Ctrl , .\nShortcut keys Keystrokes for common actions Shortcuts →\n"},{id:1,href:"https://support.deepdwn.com/docs/guide/shortcuts/",title:"Shortcuts",description:"Application shortcut list",content:"Application shortcuts    Shortcut Description      Ctrl .
